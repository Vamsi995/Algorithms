# a trickiest sorting algorithm but better according to me, simply iterates over all the elements of a given array to be sorted. Considers every 'i' th element in every parse as temp and sets j to i-1 to compare the current element from the past ones. Under the for loop, a while loop is placed which aims to iterate over the elements until a condition (Till the time when the elements are out of order) and in every parse of the while loop it decrements j to traverse back to the past elements and check them against the temp element. Finally, the temp element is placed at the appropriate position i.e where the while loop terminated lastly.

# Best case : Î©(n)
# Worst case : O(n^2)

    # array takes in space separated numbers from the user

        map(int, input("Enter the numbers separated with space: ").strip().split(" ")))
